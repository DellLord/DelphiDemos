#Two finger pan gesture

##Brief Description 
In Firemonkey, as you know, there is a great support for gestures: standard and interactive. The most important interactive gestures as Zoom, Pan, Rotate, DoubleTap (with an amazing description in dockwiki ), etc... are provided by the framework. See here for a full documentation. In a recent project I had the need to implement 2 finger pan gesture, that is not present in the provided gestures. But Firemonkey is a very great framework, and you can implement an event handler to manage custom actions when OnTouch occurs to specify what happens when a user touches the form using a finger or a similar device (not a mouse). 
In this demo I implemented the OnTouch event to simulate two finger pan gesture.
