#Access Marvel Developer API

##Brief Description 
Marvel has recent made available The Marvel Comics API, that allows developers everywhere to access information about Marvel Universe. "The Marvel Comics API is a RESTful service which provides methods for accessing specific resources at canonical URLs and for searching and filtering sets of resources by various criteria. All representations are encoded as JSON objects".
So my idea is to access these API with the Delphi REST Client Library and create an awesome app.

If you compile the project, you will notice that missing the ConstantU.pas that provides 2 constants: PUBLIC_KEY and PRIVATE_KEY. This because you have to use your personal keys (provided by developer marvel portal).
