#Interstitial AdMob

##Brief Description 
In this demo I show how to implement interstitial ads from AdMob on Android platform. 
The TBannerAd component that ships with Delphi does not support the full page ad (called an interstitial).
This sample code utilizes the TJInterstitialAd java interface object on Android to show the AdMob interstitial ad.
